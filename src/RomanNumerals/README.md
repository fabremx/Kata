# Roman Numerals

## Instructions

### Part 1

The Kata says you should write a function to convert from normal numbers to Roman Numerals: eg

```
1 --> I
10 --> X
7 --> VII
```

etc.

For a full description of how it works, take a look at [this useful reference website] : which includes an implementation of the Kata in javascript.

There is no need to be able to convert numbers larger than about 3000. (The Romans themselves didnâ€™t tend to go any higher)

### Part 2 

Write a function to convert in the other direction, ie numeral to digit
